# ETL Automation for Weather Station Data

This repository contains an automated ETL pipeline for managing weather station data using **Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)**. It integrates various weather station data sources, processes the data, and provides reports for monitoring and operational needs. The system is divided into three main jobs:

1. **DailyAutoCollectDataAWS**: Automates data collection from weather stations.
2. **DailyAutoSummaryDataAWS**: Summarizes collected data and sends reports to the internal IT team.
3. **AWSAutoReportToOC**: Creates weekly reports for each Operating Center (OC) to notify of missing or incorrectly formatted data.

## 📖 **Project Overview**

### **Workflow Summary**

- **DailyAutoCollectDataAWS**: Collects data, uploads it to a SQL Server database, and stores a backup copy in the local directory.
- **DailyAutoSummaryDataAWS**: Automatically runs after data collection, generates summaries, and sends monitoring reports to the IT team.
- **AWSAutoReportToOC**: Sends weekly alerts to OCs only if data issues are detected (missing or incorrect format). No alerts are sent if data is complete.

### **Supported Weather Station Types**

1. **Davis**
2. **Watchdog**
3. **Meteo**
4. **Unidata**
5. **Manual (Ombrometer)**

## 🔄 **Data Flow**

### **Data Collection Workflow**

1. **Data Sources**:

   - **Davis, Watchdog, Meteo**: Input files in `.txt` format.
   - **Unidata, Manual (Ombrometer)**: Input files in `.xlsx` format.

2. **Process**:

   - Data is loaded into a **SQL Server database**.
   - Original files are saved as **backup** in a local directory.

### **Automation**

- **DailyAutoSummaryDataAWS** runs automatically after **DailyAutoCollectDataAWS** finishes.
- Reports are sent based on the latest collected data.
